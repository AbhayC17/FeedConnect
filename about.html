      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>FeedConnect is a community-driven platform dedicated to connecting surplus food providers with NGOs and volunteers who can distribute it to those in need. We aim to reduce food waste and fight hunger by making food redistribution easier and more accessible.</p>
      
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto;">
        <li>Food donors post surplus food with pickup details.</li>
        <li>Nearby volunteers or NGOs get notified and arrange a pickup.</li>
        <li>Food is safely delivered to people who need it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
      <p>Whether you're a restaurant, an individual with extra food, or someone willing to help distribute, your contribution can make a difference. Join us in creating a world without food waste.</p>
